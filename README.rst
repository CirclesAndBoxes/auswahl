AUSWAHL
============================================================

AUSWAHL (**AU**\tomatic **S**\election of **WA**\velengt\ **H** **L**\ibrary) is a python module
that provides a collection of Feature Selection Methods for Near-Infrared Spectroscopy.

Scope
-----
This library provides a collection of supervised feature selection methods for near-infrared spectra.
(Note, that features are also called variables of simply wavelengths in the field of chemometrics.)
It does **not** provide any preprocessing methods or calibration models.
All features selection methods have been implemented in compliance with the sklearn library.
Thus, the methods can be used in a sklearn pipeline before an estimator.

Methods
-------
The libraray provides methods for selecting wavelengths without spatial constraints and methods for selecting continuous bands of wavelengths.
The following methods are implemented:

- Wavelength Point Selection: VIP, MC-UVE, CARS
- Wavelength Interval Selection: I-RF
